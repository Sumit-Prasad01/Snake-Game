# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented using the `pygame` library in Python. The goal is to control the snake to eat the food, grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls or itself.

## Features

- **Movement**: The snake can move in four directions: Up, Down, Left, and Right.
- **Snake Growth**: Each time the snake eats a fruit, its size increases and the score increases by 10 points.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake hits the walls or itself.
- **Score**: The score is displayed at the top of the screen and updates every time the snake eats a fruit.
